# Settings

The following table describe all the configuration options you can set for the application. All the settings can be set
using env variables with the format `JIRA_TUI_<name>`, where `<name>` is the name of the setting in the table below.

Example: these are equivalent `JIRA_TUI_JIRA_API_USERNAME=foo@bar`, `jira_api_username=foo@bar`

The application uses the [XDG specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/) to locate
config (and log) files. The default name of the config file is `config.yaml`. You can override the location of the
config file via the env variable `JIRA_TUI_CONFIG_FILE`. The application will attempt to load the config
file in the following way:

1. If the variable `JIRA_TUI_CONFIG_FILE` is set it will use the file specified by it.
2. If not, if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set then it will load the file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jiratui/config.yaml`.
3. If not, it will attempt to load the file from `$HOME/.config/jiratui/config.yaml`.
