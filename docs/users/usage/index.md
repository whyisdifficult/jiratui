# Usage

## Shell Completions

JiraTUI supports shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, and fish. To generate a completion script, use:

```shell
$ jiratui completions [bash|zsh|fish]
```

For example, to generate a completion script for zsh:

```shell
$ jiratui completions zsh
```

You can then follow your shell's instructions to enable completions. For more details, see the [Click documentation on shell completion](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/shell-completion/).

## Launching the UI

Once you have provided the necessary settings, you can run the application's UI with the following command:

```shell
$ jiratui ui
```

If you are using a custom config file, run:

```shell
$ JIRA_TUI_CONFIG_FILE=my-file.yaml jiratui ui
```

If everything works fine you should see the screen shown in the image below

```{figure} /_static/assets/images/jiratui_home.png
:align: center

```

### Passing Optional Arguments to the UI

`jiratui ui` supports optional arguments that you can use to set options in the UI upon start up. You can view the list
of supported arguments with the following command:

```shell
$ jiratui ui --help
Usage: jiratui ui [OPTIONS]

  Launches the JiraTUI application.

Options:
  -p, --project-key TEXT           A case-sensitive Jira project key.
  -w, --work-item-key TEXT         A case-sensitive key of a work item.
  -u, --assignee-account-id TEXT   A Jira user account ID. Typically this would be your Jira account ID so user-related
                                   dropdowns can pre-select your user
  -j, --jql-expression-id INTEGRER The ID of a JQL expression as defined in the config.
  -t, --theme TEXT                 The name of the theme to use.
  --search-on-startup              Trigger search automatically when the UI starts.
```

#### Trigger Search on Startup

If you want the application to automatically perform a search as soon as the UI starts, use the `--search-on-startup` flag:

```shell
$ jiratui ui --search-on-startup
```

#### Selecting a Theme

JiraTUI allows you to set the theme of the UI when you launch it. Currently, the application supports the themes
pre-defined by the [underlying framework](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/design/#themes).

You can list the supported themes with the `jiratui themes` command:

```shell
$ jiratui themes

┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Name             ┃ Usage via CLI                       ┃ Usage via Config                 ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ textual-dark     │ jiratui ui --theme textual-dark     │ config.theme: "textual-dark"     │
│ textual-light    │ jiratui ui --theme textual-light    │ config.theme: "textual-light"    │
│ nord             │ jiratui ui --theme nord             │ config.theme: "nord"             │
│ gruvbox          │ jiratui ui --theme gruvbox          │ config.theme: "gruvbox"          │
│ catppuccin-mocha │ jiratui ui --theme catppuccin-mocha │ config.theme: "catppuccin-mocha" │
│ textual-ansi     │ jiratui ui --theme textual-ansi     │ config.theme: "textual-ansi"     │
│ dracula          │ jiratui ui --theme dracula          │ config.theme: "dracula"          │
│ tokyo-night      │ jiratui ui --theme tokyo-night      │ config.theme: "tokyo-night"      │
│ monokai          │ jiratui ui --theme monokai          │ config.theme: "monokai"          │
│ flexoki          │ jiratui ui --theme flexoki          │ config.theme: "flexoki"          │
│ catppuccin-latte │ jiratui ui --theme catppuccin-latte │ config.theme: "catppuccin-latte" │
│ solarized-light  │ jiratui ui --theme solarized-light  │ config.theme: "solarized-light"  │
└──────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘
```

The default theme is `textual-dark`.

To start the UI with a different theme you can pass the name of the theme to the `ui` command. For example, the
following command will start the UI with the theme `dracula`.

```shell
$ jiratui ui --theme dracula
```

For more details refer to [Choosing a Theme](../configuration/configuration.md#choosing-a-theme)

#### Select a Jira Project on Start Up

If you want your app to pre-select a project in the projects dropdown you can pass the project key with the argument
`--project-key`. If the project exists the app will pre-select it.

```{tip}
You can configure the app to always do this by setting the variable `default_project_key_or_id` in the config
file. That way you do not need to pass this argument when you start the app.
```

```shell
$ jiratui ui --project-key PROJECT-1
```

#### Select a Jira User on Start Up

If you want your app to pre-select a/your Jira user in the assignees dropdown you can pass the user account ID with
the argument `--assignee-account-id`. If the user exists the app will pre-select it.

```{tip}
You can configure the app to always do this by setting the variable `jira_account_id` in the config
file. That way you do not need to pass this argument when you start the app.
```

```shell
$ jiratui ui --assignee-account-id 12345-67890
```

#### Select a Jira Work Item on Start Up

If you want your app to pre-select a Jira issue in the "work item key" field you can pass the work item key with
the argument `--work-item-key`.

```shell
$ jiratui ui --work-item-key ISSUE-1
```

#### Select a Jira JQL Expression on Start Up

If you defined JQL expressions via the config variable `pre_defined_jql_expressions` and you would like the app to
use a specific expression to search work items when no other criteria is selected then you can pass the argument
`--jql-expression-id` with the ID of the expression.

```{tip}
You can configure the app to always do this by setting the variable `jql_expression_id_for_work_items_search` in the
config file. That way you do not need to pass this argument when you start the app.
```

```shell
$ jiratui ui --jql-expression-id 1
```

## Using the UI

### Navigation

You can move around in the UI with the `tab` key or, by using your mouse. However, if you want to move faster you can
jump to some of the components by pressing a single key. Some components in UI indicate between parenthesis the key that
you can use to jump to them. For example, to quickly jump to the Project dropdown you can simply click `p`. If the focus
is currently on a component you need to press `esc` to move the focus out of the current component and then press the
key you desire. The following table summaries the hot-keys and the component they activate.

| Key | Component                                         |

All these bindings above are always displayed at the bottom of the app depending on the component you are focus on.

### Searching Work Items

JiraTUI supports a few ways to search work items.

#### Search using filters

You can use the filters at the top of the app to setup the criteria you want to use for searching work items. Once
you select the desired values simply click `ctrl+r` or, click the `Search` button.

The maximum number of results that the app will retrieve and show is controlled by the setting
`search_results_per_page`. The default value is 30. If the search criteria yields work items the app will display them
in the Work Items pane on the left.

##### Search by Work Item Key

This expects a case-sensitive string. If defined, this has precedence over all the other search criteria.

##### Search by Work Item Type

Search work items based on their type. If a project is selected then this list will contain the type of work items
supported by the project. If no project is selected then this list will contain all the types of work items available
in the known projects.

```{Important}
This list may contain types with duplicated names when there is no project selected. The id of these
types will be different though.
```

##### Search by Status

Search work items based on their status. If a project is selected then this list will contain the statuses supported by
the work types in the project. If no project is selected then this list will contain all possible statuses.

##### Search by Assignee

Search work items based on their assignee. If a project is selected then this list will contain the active users that
can have work items assigned in the project. If no project is selected then this list will contain all available
(active) users.

##### Search by Created From Date

If defined, only work items that were created after this date (inclusive) will be fetched.

If no `Created From` and `Created Until` search criteria are defined then the tool will fetch work items created
within the last 15 days. The number of days can be specified by the configuration variable
`search_issues_default_day_interval`.

##### Search by Created Until Date

If defined, only work items that were created until this date (inclusive) will be fetched.

If no `Created From` and `Created Until` search criteria are defined then the tool will fetch work items created
within the last 15 days. The number of days can be specified by the configuration variable
`search_issues_default_day_interval`

##### Search by Active Sprint

When this checkbox is checked the application will filter work items that correspond to the currently active
sprint.

#### Searching using full-text search

In addition to searching using the filters above, JiraTUI allows you to search items using full-text
search. This type of search has 2 modes: standard and advanced.

- **Standard Full-text Search**: this modes searches items using the items' summary and description fields. This uses
  queries of the form `summary ~ "search term" OR description ~ "search term"`.

- **Advanced Full-text Search**: in addition to searching items using the items' summary and description fields, this
  modes also searches items by using any text-based field. This includes comments. This uses
  queries of the form `text ~ "search term".

If you want/need to disable advanced full-text search you can do so with the setting
`enable_advanced_full_text_search`. Also, the setting `full_text_search_minimum_term_length` controls the minimum
length of the search term to activate the search. Independently of the value you enter for this variable JiraTUI imposes
a minimum of 3 characters.

For more details on full-text search in Jira refer to
<https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/jql-fields/#Text>) and
<https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/search-for-work-items-using-the-text-field/>.

```{important}
Full-text search is only available when you connect to the Jira Cloud Platform. This feature is not
available when you connect to Jira Data Center (aka. server, on-premises).
```

To activate full-text search press `/`. Enter the search term in the pop-up and hit `enter`.

#### Searching Using JQL Expressions

Another way to search work items in JiraTUI is by crafting your own [JQL query](). You can do so using the JQL Query
input field. In addition, you can also define your own JQL query expressions and save them in the config file using the
setting `pre_defined_jql_expressions`. This is a YAML dictionary of expressions. When you focus on the JQL Query input
field (`j`) and press `ctrl+e` the JQL Editor opens. Here you can write a complex query or, choose one from the
dropdown.

**Examples**

Search work items assigned to John Smith

```python
assignee = "John Smith"
```

or searching by the user's email address:

```python
assignee = "john@smith.com"
```

### Filtering Search Results

Search results can be filtered as well. In order to do this simply focus on the results table by pressing `1` and then
press `.`. This opens up an input field where you can enter the term you want to use to filter the results further.
Items are filtered by their `summary` field. Keep in mind that the filtering only applies to the current page.

This feature is controlled by the setting `search_results_page_filtering_enabled`. The minimum length of the search
term is controlled by the setting `search_results_page_filtering_minimum_term_length`; the default is 3.

```{tip}
Pressing `escape` hides the search box.
```

### Setting Search Filters

The 4 filters at the top are linked together. More specifically, when you choose a project from the Projects dropdown
the possible options for the types of issues filter, applicable status codes filters and the list of users (assignees)
get automatically updated. This is because the values of these 3 filters may vary with each project. The interaction
between these 4 filters is depicted in the following flowchart.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A(((App Starts Up))) --> PS
    PS{Project key provided?}
    PS --> |Yes| FSP[Fetch Single Project A]
    PS --> |No| FP[Fetch All Projects]

    FSP --> UPS[Update project dropdown]
    UPS --> SPD[Select project A in dropdown]
    SPD --> FPIT[[Fetch Project A Issue Types]]
    SPD --> FPIS[[Fetch Project A Issue Statuses]]
    SPD --> FPU[[Fetch Project A Users]]

    FP --> FPO{Config.on_start_up_only_fetch_projects == False}
    FPO -->|Yes| Z((End))
    FPO -->|No| FPIT
    FPO -->|No| FPIS
    FPO -->|No| FPU

    FPIT --> Z((End))
    FPIS --> Z((End))
    FPU --> Z((End))
```

#### Projects List

The list of projects depends on the permissions of the logged-in user. For a project to appear on this list
one of these conditions must be satisfied:

- The user Jira account must have the [Browse Projects project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
  for the project.
- The user Jira account must have the [Administer Projects project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
  for the project.
- The user Jira account must have the [Administer Jira global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg).

By default, JiraTUI will retrieve all available projects. However, if you set the config variable
`default_project_key_or_id` with a case-sensitive project key then the app will only fetch and load that project. If
no project is found or the user does not have permissions to browse projects then this list will be empty.

#### Issues Types List

If you select a project then JiraTUI will retrieve all the applicable issue types for the selected project. If no
project is selected then the list of issue types will include all known issue types. Keep in mind that in this case the
dropdown may contain types with the same name; because they belong to different projects. The following flowchart shows
how the list of issues types gets populated.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A(((App Starts Up))) --> PS
    PS{User selected project A from dropdown?}
    PS --> |Yes| FPIT[Fetch types of issues for the project A]
    PS --> |No| FAIT[Fetch All Issue Types]
    FPIT --> ITD[Update Issue Types dropdown]
    FAIT --> ITD[Update Issue Types dropdown]
    ITD --> Z((End))
```

#### Issue Status Codes

If you select a project then JiraTUI will retrieve all the applicable statis codes applicable to the issue types of the
selected project. If no project is selected then the list of statuses will include all known status codes. Keep in mind
that in this case the dropdown may contain statuses with the same name; because they belong to different projects. The
following flowchart shows how the list of issues statuses gets populated.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A(((App Starts Up))) --> B
    B{User selected project A from dropdown?}
    B --> |Yes| C[Fetch statuses for the project A]
    B --> |No| D[Fetch all available statuses]
    C --> Y[Update Issues Statuses dropdown]
    D --> Y[Update Issues Statuses dropdown]
    Y --> Z((End))
```

#### List of Users

If you select a project then JiraTUI will retrieve all the users that can be assigned issues in the given
project. Otherwise, the app will attempt to find all the users that belong to the group ID defined in
`jira_user_group_id`.

```{Important}
Fetching users by group id is only supported in the Jira Cloud Platform.
```

The following flowchart shows how the list of users/assignees gets populated.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A(((App Starts Up))) --> B
    B{User selected project A from dropdown?}
    B --> |Yes| C[Fetch users assignable to project A]
    B --> |No| E{Config.jira_user_group_id is set?}
    E --> |Yes| F[Fetch users in the given group]
    E --> |No| Error[Unable to find users]
    C --> Y[Update Users dropdown]
    F --> Y[Update Users dropdown]
    Error --> Y[Update Users dropdown]
    Y --> Z((End))
```

### Creating Work Items

To create a work item you can press `ctrl+n`. This will open up a modal screen with a form to provide the necessary
fields to create the work item. Fields marked with `(*)` are required. If the item is created successfully a message
will pop up in the app indicating the work item key.

### Updating Work Items

This contains the details of the selected work item. Some of these details can be edited/updated. Currently, the
fields that can be updated are:

- Summary
- Assignee
- Status
- Priority
- Due Date
- Labels
- Parent

To edit a field simply focus on it, change its value and then press `^s` to save the changes.

**Updating the parent of an issue**

Jira arranges the type sof issues into a hierarchy. This hierarchy is used to determine whether an issue can have
another issue as a parent. For example, an Epic can not have a parent issue. Issues of type Story, Task, Bug and
Subtask do accept parents.

```{important}
JiraTUI disables the parent field of an issue when its type does not allow parents to be set; e.g. for Epics.

## CLI Interface

In addition to the `ui` command, the CLI tool offers several commands to help you manage issues, comments, and
users.

```{note}
The CLI tool offers a simples interface for interacting with Jira when compared to the UI app. It's only meant to be
used as a quick tool for some common tasks, for example, transitioning items from one staus to another. For a comore
complete experience the UI is recommended.
```

### Searching for Issues

The CLI has a command to search work items by different criteria.

```shell
$ jiratui issues search --help
Usage: jiratui issues search [OPTIONS]

  Search work items.

Options:
  -p, --project-key TEXT          A case-sensitive key that identifies a project.
  -k, --key TEXT                  A case-sensitive key that identifies a work item.
  -u, --assignee-account-id TEXT  The account ID of a user to filter work items.
  -l, --limit INTEGER             The number of work items to return. Default is 10 items within the last 15 days.
  --created-from [%Y-%m-%d]       Searches issues created from this date forward (inclusive). Expects YYYY-MM-DD
  --created-until [%Y-%m-%d]      Searches issues created until this date (inclusive). Expects YYYY-MM-DD
```

To search for work items in the project `SCRUM`, use the issues search command and pass the `--project-key` argument
with the (case-sensitive) project key.

**Example**: searching for issues of the project `SCRUM`

```shell
$ jiratui issues search --project-key SCRUM

| Key     | Type | Created          | Status (ID)   | Reporter          | Assignee          | Summary                                    |
|---------|------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| SCRUM-1 | Bug  | 2025-07-31 15:55 | To Do (10000) | lisa@simpson.com  | bart@simpson.com  | Write 100 times "I will be a good student" |
| SCRUM-2 | Task | 2025-06-30 15:56 | To Do (10000) | homer@simpson.com | homer@simpson.com | Eat donuts                                 |
```

To search for a specific work item, use the issues search command with the `--key` (or `-k`) argument and the (case-sensitive)
issue key.

**Example**: searching for the issue with key `SCRUM-1`

```shell
$ jiratui issues search --key SCRUM-1

| Key     | Type | Created          | Status (ID)   | Reporter          | Assignee          | Summary                                    |
|---------|------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| SCRUM-1 | Bug  | 2025-07-31 15:55 | To Do (10000) | lisa@simpson.com  | bart@simpson.com  | Write 100 times "I will be a good student" |
```

The command allows you to limit the number of items you search. Simply pass the `-l` argument with the number of items
you want to retrieve. In addition, you can filter items based on the creation date with the arguments `--created-from`
and `--created-until`.

### Show Metadata

The tool also provides a command to show metadata associated to a work item. This is useful when you need to update a
work item; for example if you want to transition the state of the item and you need to know the ID of the state.

```shell
$ jiratui issues metadata SCRUM-1

Valid work types for work item: SCRUM-1

| ID     | Name | Current?  | Description                                 |
|--------|------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Bug  | Yes       | Tasks track small, distinct pieces of work. |
| 2      | Task |           | Bugs track problems or errors.              |

Valid priority IDs for work item: SCRUM-1

| ID     | Name | Current?  | Example   |
|--------|------|-----------|-----------|
| 1      | High  |          |           |

Valid status transitions for work item: SCRUM-1

| Transition ID  | Status ID | Status Name  | Current?   | Example                                      |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1              | 5         | To Do        | Yes        | <CLI> issues update <ITEM-KEY> --status-id 5 |
| 2              | 6         | Done         |            | <CLI> issues update <ITEM-KEY> --status-id 6 |
```

### Update Work Items

The `issues metadata` command is useful because you can get the data necessary for updating work items.

The command `issues update` can be used to update (some of the) fields of a work item. The (sub)command requires you
to provide the case-sensitive key of the work item you want to update.

```shell
$ jiratui issues update --help

Usage: jiratui issues update [OPTIONS] WORK_ITEM_KEY

  Updates (some) fields of the work item identified by WORK_ITEM_KEY.

  WORK_ITEM_KEY is the case-sensitive key that identifies the work item we want to update.

Options:
  -s, --summary TEXT              Text to set as the summary (aka. title) of the work item.
  -u, --assignee-account-id TEXT  The account ID of the user to whom the work item will be assigned. Pass -u "" or -u null to unassign the work item.
  -d, --due-date [%Y-%m-%d]       Update the due date of an issue. Expects YYYY-MM-DD
  --meta                          Shows metadata for an issue. This is useful for updates.
  -t, --status-id INTEGER         The ID of the status to set for the work item. Use --meta for more details.
  -p, --priority-id INTEGER       The ID of the priority to set for the work item. Use --meta for more details.
```

#### Update Summary

To update the summary of a work item you can pass the `-s` argument with the summary you want to set. For example,

```shell
$ jiratui issues update SCRUM-1 -s "Update the payment method"
```

#### Update Due Date

To update the due date of a work item you can pass the `-d` argument with the date value you want to set. For example,

```shell
$ jiratui issues update SCRUM-1 -d 2025-12-31
```

#### Update Assignee

To update the assignee of a work item you can pass the `-u` argument with the ID of the user's account you want to
set. For example,

```shell
$ jiratui issues update SCRUM-1 -u 12345
```

```{tip}
If you do not know the ID of a user you can use the [search users command](#search-users) to find out.
```

If you want to unassign an issue yu can do so by passing an empty string to the argument `-u` or, `-u null`.

```shell
$ jiratui issues update SCRUM-1 -u ""
```

#### Update Status

To update the status of a work item you can pass the `-t` argument with the ID of the status you want to set. For
example,

```shell
$ jiratui issues update SCRUM-1 -t 6
```

This will allow you to transition the work item with key `SCRUM-1` from the current status to the status Done. See the
[metadata command](index.md#show-metadata) above for the context.

#### Update Priority

To update the priority of a work item you can pass the `-p` argument with the ID of the priority you want to set. For
example,

```shell
$ jiratui issues update SCRUM-1 -p 1
```

This will allow you to set the priority of the work item with key `SCRUM-1` to High. See the
[metadata command](show-metadata) above for the context.

### Listing Comments

To list the comments of a work item use the `comments list` command and pass the (case-sensitive) key of the work
item whose comments you want to list.

```shell
$ jiratui comments list SCRUM-1

| ID | Issue Key | Author             | Created          | Updated          | Message      |
|----|-----------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1  | SCRUM-1   | maggie@simpson.com | 2025-12-31 16:09 | 2025-12-31 16:09 | Hello World! |
```

If you want to see the text of a specific comment use the `comments show` command and pass the (case-sensitive) key of
the work item followed by the ID of the comment.

```shell
$ jiratui comments show SCRUM-1 1

Hello World!
```

### Adding Comments

To add a comment to a work item use the `comments add` command and pass the (case-sensitive) key of the work
item and the comment string you want to add.

```shell
$ jiratui comments add SCRUM-1 'My new comment'

| ID | Issue Key | Author             | Created          | Updated          | Message        |
|----|-----------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1  | SCRUM-1   | maggie@simpson.com | 2025-12-31 16:09 | 2025-12-31 16:09 | Hello World!   |
| 2  | SCRUM-1   | maggie@simpson.com | 2025-12-31 16:29 | 2025-12-31 16:29 | My new comment |
```

### Deleting a Comment

```shell
$ jiratui comments delete SCRUM-1 2

Comment deleted successfully.

$ jiratui comments list SCRUM-1

| ID | Issue Key | Author             | Created          | Updated          | Message      |
|----|-----------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1  | SCRUM-1   | maggie@simpson.com | 2025-12-31 16:09 | 2025-12-31 16:09 | Hello World! |
```

### Search Users

You can search users with the command `users search` providing (part of) the name or email address of the
user. In the following example we are searching for any user whose name or email include the string `maggie`.

```shell
$ jiratui users search maggie

| Account ID | Active | Name           | Email Address      |
|------------|--------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1          | True   | maggie simpson | maggie@simpson.com |
```

### Searching User Groups

You can also search user groups. This is useful if you need to know the ID of a group. For example, if you need to set
up the value of the configuration option `jira_user_group_id`.

In order to list all the known user groups in your Jira instance you can use the command `users groups`. The command
accepts 2 optional arguments to paginate results: `--offset` and `--limit`.

```shell
$ jiratui users groups

| ID   | Name         | Total users in group? |
|------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 1    | admin users  | 2                     |
| 2    | developers   | 20                    |
```

You can also search groups by the (exact) name. For example,

```shell
$ jiratui users groups --group-names developers

| ID   | Name         | Total users in group? |
|------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 2    | developers   | 20                    |
```
